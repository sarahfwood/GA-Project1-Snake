## Overview
This is my first project from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course (SEI44). 

This is an individual project and we were given a week to complete.


## Technical Requirements

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


## How to Play
  Snake is a single-player game where the player earns points by guiding the snake to eat food randomly placed on the game board. Each item of food the snake eats the longer it grows. The game is over if the snake hits the edge of the board, or itself. To make things even more challenging, the snake increases speed as the longer it gets!
  The aim of the game is to stay alive as long as possible.
