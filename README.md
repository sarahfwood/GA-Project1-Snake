How to Play
  Snake is a single-player game where the player earns points by guiding the snake to eat food randomly placed on the game board. Each item of food the snake eats the longer it grows. The game is over if the snake hits the edge of the board, or itself. To make things even more challenging, the snake increases speed as the longer it gets!
  The aim of the game is to stay alive as long as possible.

Requirements
  The snake should be able to eat food to grow bigger
  The game should end when the snake hits the wall or itself
  Snake speeds up as it eats more
